### Nikto

***Nikto Web Scanner*** is a Web server scanner that tests Web servers for dangerous files/CGIs, outdated server software and other problems. It performs generic and server type specific checks. It also captures and prints any cookies received.

####Integrate Nikto with Nessus
Modify /opt/nikto/nikto.pl and change the location of the configuration file:

Add the following line to /etc/profile and update the system-wide path to include Nikto (I've also added the directories containing the Nessus binaries):

>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/nikto:/opt/nessus/bin:/opt/nessus/sbin

Re-compile and re-index the Nessus plugins:
> /opt/nessus/sbin/nessusd -R

Restart Nessus

> /etc/init.d/nessusd restart
